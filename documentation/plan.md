* Add visualisation of R* by quantile of each parameter
* Separate out examples, each into its own file, using common r_star and r_star_distribution files
  * [ ] Eight schools
  * [ ] Ar1
  * [ ] Bivariate normal
  * [ ] Wide datasets
  * [x] Trends

* For normal datasets, include how far the distributions are from the truth:
  * Plot of $R^*$ vs KL divergence
  * Same but with $\hat{R}$
* $R^*$ vs iterations for each of the problems (where there is a known truth)
